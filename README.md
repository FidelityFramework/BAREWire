## Overview

BAREWire implements the [BARE (Binary Application Record Encoding)](https://baremessages.org/) protocol with F#'s type system providing compile-time safety. It enables zero-copy operations, structured memory access, and efficient inter-process communication - all without runtime overhead.

### Key Characteristics

- **Zero Dependencies**: Pure F# implementation (FSharp.UMX for phantom types)
- **Type Safety**: Leverages units of measure for compile-time memory safety
- **Zero-Copy Operations**: Direct memory access without intermediate allocations
- **Schema-Driven**: Type-safe DSL for defining binary data structures
- **Modular Design**: Use only the components you need

## The Fidelity Framework

BAREWire is part of the **Fidelity** native F# compilation ecosystem:

| Project | Role |
|---------|------|
| **[Firefly](https://github.com/speakez-llc/firefly)** | AOT compiler: F# → PSG → MLIR → Native binary |
| **[Alloy](https://github.com/speakez-llc/alloy)** | Native standard library with platform bindings |
| **BAREWire** | Binary encoding, memory mapping, zero-copy IPC |
| **[Farscape](https://github.com/speakez-llc/farscape)** | C/C++ header parsing for native library bindings |
| **[XParsec](https://github.com/speakez-llc/xparsec)** | Parser combinators powering PSG traversal and header parsing |

The name "Fidelity" reflects the framework's core mission: **preserving type and memory safety** from source code through compilation to native execution.

## Core Concepts

BAREWire provides four interconnected capabilities:

### 1. Schema Definition

Define binary data structures with a type-safe DSL:

```fsharp
open BAREWire.Schema.DSL

let messageSchema =
    schema "Message"
    |> withType "UserId" string
    |> withType "Timestamp" int64
    |> withType "Content" string
    |> withType "Message" (struct' [
        field "sender" (userType "UserId")
        field "timestamp" (userType "Timestamp")
        field "content" (userType "Content")
    ])
    |> validate
    |> Result.get
```

### 2. Binary Encoding/Decoding

Convert between F# values and compact binary representations:

```fsharp
open BAREWire.Encoding.Codec

type Message = {
    Sender: string
    Timestamp: int64
    Content: string
}

// Encode to bytes
let encoded = encode messageSchema message buffer

// Decode from bytes
let decoded = decode<Message> messageSchema memory
```

### 3. Memory Mapping

Access structured data in memory without copying:

```fsharp
open BAREWire.Memory.Region
open BAREWire.Memory.View

// Create a typed memory region
let region = create<Message, heap> data

// Create a view for field access
let view = View.create<Message, heap> region messageSchema

// Read fields directly from memory
let sender = View.getField<Message, string, heap> view ["sender"]
```

### 4. Inter-Process Communication

Share typed data between processes:

```fsharp
open BAREWire.IPC.SharedMemory

// Process 1: Create shared region
let shared = create<Message> "channel" size messageSchema

// Process 2: Open existing region
let received = open'<Message> "channel" messageSchema
```

## Type Safety with Units of Measure

BAREWire uses F#'s units of measure and FSharp.UMX phantom types to prevent memory errors at compile time:

```fsharp
open FSharp.UMX
open BAREWire.Core

// Memory regions are typed
[<Measure>] type heap
[<Measure>] type stack
[<Measure>] type shared

// Offsets and sizes are dimensioned
let offset = 16<offset>
let size = 1024<bytes>

// Type system prevents mixing incompatible memory
let heapMem: Memory<Message, heap> = ...
let stackMem: Memory<Message, stack> = ...
// Cannot accidentally mix these - compile error!
```

## Hardware Integration

For embedded targets, BAREWire provides **Peripheral Descriptors** that capture memory-mapped hardware layouts:

```fsharp
type PeripheralDescriptor = {
    Name: string                          // "GPIO"
    Instances: Map<string, unativeint>    // GPIOA → 0x48000000
    Layout: PeripheralLayout
    MemoryRegion: MemoryRegionKind        // Peripheral | SRAM | Flash
}

type FieldDescriptor = {
    Name: string                          // "ODR", "BSRR"
    Offset: int                           // Byte offset from base
    Type: RegisterType
    Access: AccessKind                    // ReadOnly | WriteOnly | ReadWrite
}
```

Farscape generates these descriptors from C/C++ headers (like CMSIS HAL), and Firefly's Alex component uses them to emit correct memory-mapped access code with proper volatile semantics.

## Schema Compatibility

BAREWire includes tools for evolving schemas safely:

```fsharp
open BAREWire.Schema.Analysis

match checkCompatibility oldSchema newSchema with
| FullyCompatible ->
    printfn "Schemas are fully compatible"
| BackwardCompatible ->
    printfn "New schema can read old data"
| ForwardCompatible ->
    printfn "Old schema can read new data"
| Incompatible reasons ->
    printfn "Breaking changes: %A" reasons
```

## Performance

BAREWire is designed for high-performance scenarios:

- **Zero-copy**: Read structured data directly from memory/network buffers
- **No allocations**: Encoding/decoding can work with pre-allocated buffers
- **Compact format**: BARE encoding is smaller than JSON, MessagePack, or Protobuf
- **Type-safe without overhead**: All safety checks happen at compile time

## Installation

For .NET projects:
```bash
dotnet add package BAREWire
```

For Fidelity/Firefly projects, BAREWire is included as source files via the project configuration.

## Development Status

BAREWire is under active development. Current focus:

- Core encoding/decoding for primitive and composite types
- Memory region abstractions
- Shared memory IPC
- Peripheral descriptor support for embedded targets
